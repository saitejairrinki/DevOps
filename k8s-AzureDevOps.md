# Implementing Effective CI/CD Pipeline using 🌩️ Azure DevOps, 🐳 Docker, ☸️ Kubernetes, and 🛠️ Terraform

The project employs a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) approach utilizing Azure DevOps, Docker, Kubernetes, SonarCloud, Terraform, and PowerShell. The key steps of the project implementation are outlined below:

**Step 1: Infrastructure as Code (IAAC) with Azure DevOps** 
An Azure-based build pipeline is initiated to create the requisite infrastructure, including storage accounts, Azure Key Vault, and virtual machines. This process ensures efficient and scalable resource provisioning.
> Example Tools: Terraform, ARM, Bicep

**Step 2: Installation Quality Check Pipeline**
Following the successful execution of the infrastructure build, an installation quality pipeline is activated to assess the provisioning state and pre-configurations of the Azure resources. This validation step ensures the accurate completion of the installation process.
> Example Tools: PowerShell using Azure CLI

**Step 3: Implementation of GitFlow Branching Strategy**
The project adheres to the GitFlow branching strategy, which includes development, staging, QA, pre-production, and production branches. Multiple feature branches are created and merged based on successful pull requests, ensuring an organized and efficient development workflow. For example, 🌿 feature/new-feature-branch is created from 🌿 development for implementing specific features.

**Step 4: Configuring Separate AKS Clusters for Different Environments**
Distinct AKS clusters are set up for deploying code changes across various environments, including development, staging, pre-production, and production. These clusters are configured in subsequent release pipelines for seamless deployment management.

**Step 5: Docker Image Building Process**
The build pipeline automatically triggers upon code changes, testing the code, and converting it into Docker images. These images are then pushed to the Docker repository, facilitating streamlined code deployment and management. For instance, 🐳 Docker images like "myapp:latest" are generated from the code changes.

**Step 6: Streamlined Release Pipelines**
Upon successful Docker image publication, the release pipeline initiates four distinct stages: development, QA, staging, and production. Each stage allows for comprehensive testing and verification before moving on to the next deployment phase.

**Step 7: Dev Deployment Triggering**
The Dev release pipeline is triggered post-Docker image build, deploying the image into the designated Dev Kubernetes AKS cluster. For subsequent environments, deployment waits for QA verification and testing before further progression.

**Step 8: Deployment in Higher Environments**
Following thorough quality assurance checks, including SonarCloud Quality Gates, the staging deployment is approved, triggering the deployment process in the staging environment. Code merge from development to staging is facilitated with proper approvals and resolution of any pertinent comments.

**Step 9: Replicating the Workflow Across Environments**
With staging serving as a stable environment, the project ensures the smooth deployment of pre-production and production environments, adhering to the established approval procedures. This uniform approach guarantees consistency and reliability across all deployment stages.
