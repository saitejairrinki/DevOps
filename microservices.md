# Transitioning from a Monolithic to Microservices Architecture in Kubernetes

Migrating from a monolithic application to a microservices architecture in Kubernetes is a complex but rewarding process. This guide will walk you through the steps, detailing the roles and responsibilities of both the Dev Team and DevOps Team.

## Step-by-Step Guide with Roles and Responsibilities

### Step 1: Analyze the Existing Monolithic Application 🔍

#### Dev Team Responsibilities:
1. **Identify Services:** Determine which parts of the application can be separated into individual services.
2. **Dependencies:** Map out the dependencies between these parts.

*Example:* Suppose your application is an e-commerce platform with three main services:
- **User Service:** Handles user authentication and profile management. 👤
- **Product Service:** Manages product catalog and inventory. 📦
- **Order Service:** Processes customer orders. 🛒

### Step 2: Design the Microservices 🏗️

#### Dev Team Responsibilities:
1. **Define Boundaries:** Clearly define the boundaries of each microservice.
2. **APIs:** Design the APIs for each microservice, ensuring they can communicate with each other as needed.

*Example:* 
- **User Service API:** Endpoints for user registration, login, and profile updates. 🔑
- **Product Service API:** Endpoints for listing products, adding new products, and updating inventory. 📋
- **Order Service API:** Endpoints for placing orders, viewing order status, and managing orders. 📦

### Step 3: Refactor the Codebase 🔨

#### Dev Team Responsibilities:
1. **Extract Services:** Extract the code for each service from the monolithic codebase into separate repositories.
2. **Database Separation:** If possible, separate the databases for each service. If not, create logical separations within a single database.

*Example:* 
- Extract user-related functionalities and move them to a separate repository for the User Service. 👤
- Similarly, move product and order-related functionalities to their respective repositories. 📦🛒

### Step 4: Containerize Each Microservice 🐳

#### Dev Team Responsibilities:
1. **Create Dockerfiles:** Write Dockerfiles for each microservice.

*Example:* Dockerfile for User Service:
```dockerfile
# User Service Dockerfile
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

2. **Build Docker Images:** Build Docker images for each service.
```sh
docker build -t user-service:latest ./user-service
docker build -t product-service:latest ./product-service
docker build -t order-service:latest ./order-service
```

### Step 5: Configure Helm Charts 📜

#### DevOps Team Responsibilities:
1. **Create Separate Helm Charts:** Create Helm charts for each microservice.

*Example:* Directory structure for User Service Helm chart:
```
user-service/
  Chart.yaml
  values.yaml
  templates/
    deployment.yaml
    service.yaml
```

2. **Define Kubernetes Resources:** Write Kubernetes deployment and service definitions in the Helm chart templates.

*Example:* `deployment.yaml` for User Service:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: user-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: user-service
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: user-service
          image: user-service:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
          env:
            - name: DATABASE_URL
              value: "mongodb://mongo:27017/userdb"
```

### Step 6: Deploy to Kubernetes 🚀

#### DevOps Team Responsibilities:
1. **Deploy Each Service:** Use Helm to deploy each microservice to your Kubernetes cluster.

```sh
helm install user-service ./user-service
helm install product-service ./product-service
helm install order-service ./order-service
```

2. **Inter-Service Communication:** Ensure services can communicate with each other, typically via Kubernetes Services.

*Example:* In the `order-service` deployment, add an environment variable to point to the User Service:
```yaml
env:
  - name: USER_SERVICE_URL
    value: "http://user-service:3000"
```

### Step 7: Update and Monitor 🔄📊

#### Dev Team Responsibilities:
1. **Update APIs:** Ensure the application is updated to use the new microservices APIs.

#### DevOps Team Responsibilities:
1. **Monitor Services:** Use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the health and performance of each microservice.

### Real-Time Example 🌐

Let’s say you have the monolithic application currently deployed as a single Kubernetes deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: monolithic-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: monolithic-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: monolithic-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: monolithic-app:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          env:
            - name: DATABASE_URL
              value: "mongodb://mongo:27017/appdb"
```

After following the steps, you would have three separate deployments, one for each microservice.

### Summary 📝

#### Dev Team:
1. **Analyze** the monolith to identify services. 🔍
2. **Design** and **refactor** the codebase. 🏗️🔨
3. **Containerize** each service. 🐳
4. **Update APIs** to reflect the new microservices architecture. 🔄

#### DevOps Team:
1. **Create Helm charts** for each service. 📜
2. **Deploy services** individually using Helm. 🚀
3. **Monitor** the services using tools like Prometheus and Grafana. 📊

By following these steps and clearly delineating the roles and responsibilities, you can effectively transition your monolithic application into a scalable and manageable microservices architecture in Kubernetes.
